# E-Commerce-Search-and-Filtering-System-with-React
Small Project with no focus on CSS just on React and how to filter and Pass data from Parent to child components.

On this small project, I focused on how to use json file and work with it to be able to work with backend dev. and i focused on how to send data with props and what is props derailing. Last thing I focused on is how to filter data and how to manage your files.

i worked with states and useEffect to deploy data I faceed so many problems and I searched for it solution in Chatgpt and google.

i build this project all my own, I take the database and Desing idea from HuXn WebDev on YouTube but the work i work with my self.
